# A vanilla javascript recriation of the Among Us minigame: Unlock Manifolds
Inspired by the repo [gabrielfroes/among-us-start-reactor-game-vanilla-js](https://github.com/gabrielfroes/among-us-start-reactor-game-vanilla-js) I decided to make
my own version of one of the tasks from the game Among Us.

**OBS: This game is just for studying purposes.** I do not intend to gain nothing from this project besides knowledge.

You can test the game [here](https://unlock-manifolds.netlify.app/).

# How to play
The task consists of 10 buttons enumerated from 1 to 10 and you just have to press the buttons in the correct sequence. If you make a mistake, you lose. If you
press all the 10 buttons in the correct order, you win. Easy, right?
